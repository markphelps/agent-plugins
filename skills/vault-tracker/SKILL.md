# Vault Tracker

Unified project lifecycle management: track projects, detect mismatches between
filesystem and tracker, propose transitions, and coordinate archival.

## Command

```
vault-tracker [--mode report|apply-safe|apply] [--project NAME] [transition]
```

## Parameters

- `--mode report|apply-safe|apply` (default: `report`)
- `--project NAME` optional project name/path to scope operation
- `transition` optional explicit transition intent (e.g., `mark shipped`,
  `archive now`)

## Lifecycle States

- `active` — currently executing project
- `exploring` — early investigation, not fully committed
- `paused` — temporarily on hold
- `shipped` — completed/delivered
- `archived` — moved to `archive/`
- `fleeting` — rough idea fragment (in `ideas/fleeting/`)
- `incubating` — idea stage (in `ideas/incubating/`)
- `someday` — intentionally parked idea (in `ideas/someday/`)
- `rejected` — explicitly declined idea (in `ideas/rejected/`)

## Valid Transitions

| From                                    | To            | Conditions         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `active` ↔ `exploring`                  | Bidirectional | Reclassification   |
| `active\|exploring` → `paused`          | One-way       | Needs break point  |
| `paused` → `active`                     | One-way       | Resuming work      |
| `exploring` → `incubating`              | One-way       | Back to idea stage |
| `active\|exploring\|paused` → `shipped` | One-way       | Completion         |
| `shipped` → `archived`                  | One-way       | Final archival     |
| `fleeting` → `incubating`               | One-way       | Idea has shape     |
| `incubating` → `someday`                | One-way       | Park for later     |
| `fleeting\|incubating` → `rejected`     | One-way       | Declined idea      |

## Mode Behavior

- `report`: audit tracker vs filesystem, detect mismatches, propose transitions
- `apply-safe`: apply unambiguous tracker updates only (no file moves)
- `apply`: apply confirmed transitions including file moves and link rewrites

## Workflow

1. **Read tracker**: Load `projects/project-tracker.md`
2. **Scan projects/**: Discover project directories and their state
3. **Detect mismatches**:
   - Filesystem state vs tracker state
   - Orphan tracker entries (no matching directory)
   - Untracked projects (directory exists, not in tracker)
   - Duplicate idea or project directories that should be one lifecycle item
4. **Propose transitions and merges**:
   - Smallest valid state change per mismatch
   - Canonical merge target for duplicate ideas/projects
   - Link rewrites and tracker row consolidation required by the merge
5. **Handle idea promotion paths**:
   - `ideas/incubating/` → `projects/active/` (promote to project)
   - `ideas/fleeting/` → `ideas/incubating/` (promote idea)
   - `ideas/incubating/` → `ideas/someday/` (park idea)
   - `ideas/incubating/` → `ideas/rejected/` (decline idea)
6. **Apply by mode**:
   - `report`: return proposals with evidence and confidence
   - `apply-safe`: update tracker rows/links when unambiguous, no merges
   - `apply`: perform confirmed file moves, high-confidence merges, and inbound
     link rewrites
7. **Shipped compaction**: When a project transitions to `shipped`, immediately
   run or propose
   `vault-compact --scope projects --project <name> --mode apply --aggression aggressive`
   to merge launch artifacts, drafts, research, and stale execution notes into
   one canonical shipped project record. Absorbed curated files may be deleted
   after unique content is preserved. Never delete `raw/`.
8. **Log operation**: Append concise entry to `log.md`

## Merge Rules

Merge idea or project directories only when they represent the same underlying
thing, not just similar domains. Prefer the more advanced lifecycle state as the
canonical destination (`active` over `incubating`, `incubating` over `fleeting`)
unless the user says otherwise.

- Preserve all files by moving them into the canonical directory or appending
  sections into the canonical note.
- Consolidate tracker rows into one entry and keep former names as aliases or
  backlinks when useful.
- Rewrite inbound links to the canonical path.
- In `report` mode, show both the canonical destination and what would be moved.
- In `apply` mode, require clear evidence or explicit user instruction.

## Example Operations

```
# Report on all projects
vault-tracker --mode report

# Promote an incubating idea to active project
vault-tracker --mode apply --project my-idea promote-to-project

# Mark project as shipped
vault-tracker --mode apply-safe --project my-project mark shipped

# Archive a shipped project
vault-tracker --mode apply --project my-project archive now
```

## Safety

- **Never delete project files** — archive moves only
- **Never discard duplicate project or idea material** — merge or move it
- **Confirmation required** for destructive moves (archive transitions)
- **Link integrity**: Check/rewrite inbound links before archival
- **Tracker ≠ sole history**: Keep project docs as source of truth
- **Skip archive operations** for `active/exploring` without explicit evidence
- **Never touch** `raw/processed/*` or hidden/system directories

## Report Scope

Default scope is live surface only (`active`, `exploring`, `paused`). Include
`shipped`/`archived` only when explicitly requested via `--project` or explicit
transition.

## Compose Existing Skills

- `vault-lint` for stale/orphan detection and wikilink issues
- `vault-compact` for post-shipping project document consolidation
- `vault-concepts` for recurring theme promotion
- `vault-maintain` for periodic full-vault upkeep

## Output

Return:

- Transitions applied/proposed with evidence and confidence
- Mismatches detected (filesystem vs tracker)
- Files moved/renamed and link rewrites applied
- Merges applied/proposed with canonical target and retained aliases
- Idea promotions (incubating→project, fleeting→incubating)
- Tracker sections changed
- Touched files
- Skipped items and rationale
